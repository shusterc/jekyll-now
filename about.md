I recently completed my internal medicine residency at the University of British Columbia. I am originally from Toronto and I speak three languages. My interests in math, computer science and technology have now led me to embark on a journey of learning data science! I am currently completing a Master of Data Science degree at UBC and hope to use these newfound knowledge and skills towards improving patient care in the future.

Outside of being permanently stuck in the 'student' phase of life, I enjoy spending time in the outdoors. Hiking, camping, skiing and kayaking are some of my favourite activities to do in my spare time when I don't have enough time to travel outside of Canada. I am also an avid swimmer and love to play chess!
