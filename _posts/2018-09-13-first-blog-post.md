title: My first blog post!

Wow! I would have never guessed that one day I would create my own blog - this is pretty neat! 

Although not even two weeks have passed in the Master of Data Science program, I can easily conclude (with high probability :p) that this was the right direction for my career. It has been so exciting to get back to programming, solving math and statistics problems, creating work on the web (like this!) and most importantly meeting a whole new group of amazing people from all walks of life and parts of the globe. It's interesting how data science is slowly making its way into all kinds of industries; today we even had a professor from linguistics sit in on a class and explain how he is interested in creating a similarly structured program for the subject of computational linguistics! 

For me, I am interested in the intersection between data science and healthcare. If I ever doubted whether one exists or would exist, or if this was truly a good career decision or just a fantasy thought, it only took a few days to hear about the all too familiar term *Bayes' Theorem* in class. For many in internal medicine, this concept drives how we make decisions about patient care. To put it simply, as an internist, a lot of our work is centered around taking information about a patient and computing the probability of a particular diagnosis. We use a patient's history as a starting point and then perform physical exam maneuvers, order lab work and obtain imaging to help us increase or reduce the probability that a patient has a particular diagnosis we are thinking about. The result of each of these tests helps us assess the probability of said diagnosis being present. 

In Canada, it takes at least 8 years from medical school to completion of residency to become an internal medicine physician, I wonder how long it would take a computer?
